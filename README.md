## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Covid19 dataset from Kaggle to better understand:
#### Question 1.In which state the chance of getting infected with covid19 is high ?
#### Question 2.In which state chances of getting cured is high ?
#### Question 3.In which state the fatality rate is high ?
#### Question 4.Which state has tested the maximum sample and which state has tested mimimum sample ?
#### Question 5.Discuss about the posive case and negative cases in the state odisha ?

## File Description
Covid-19 datascience project.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.

StatewiseTestingDetails.csv: Contains the statewise Details of Covid19 from kaggle

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
